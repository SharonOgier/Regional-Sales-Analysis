As a data analyst, your task is to keep the upper management and regional teams
updated on the sales performance. Create a dashboard using Tableau for the
organization's communication platform.
Action
1. Sales Performance Parameters:
• Create a parameter for the Primary Region and another for the
Secondary Region to allow region selection, listing all regions in them
• Create calculated fields to filter the data based on the selected regions
• Display the total sales for each region, using separate worksheets for the
primary and secondary regions
2. Average Sales and Order Statistics:
• Create a worksheet showing the average sales per order for both the
primary and secondary regions
• Include a count of the total number of orders in each region
• Filter each worksheet to display data only for the selected region
3. Customer and Product Analysis:
• Create a worksheet displaying the number of unique customers in each
region
• Create a worksheet showing the number of distinct products sold in
each region
• Apply filters to each worksheet to ensure data accuracy for the selected
regions
4. Comparative Analysis:
• Combine the individual worksheets into a single dashboard
• Use containers to partition the dashboard into sections for the primary
and secondary regions
• Add parameter controls to allow users to select different regions and
dynamically update the visualizations
